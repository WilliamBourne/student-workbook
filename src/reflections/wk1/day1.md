# What is git and why do we use it? 

- Git is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System.
- The whole copy of the code is present in every develpers' computer.
- The code in Git changes as more is added.
- We use Git because Projects in the real world usually have many developers working on it. Git makes sure there are no code conflicts and also allows the developers to go to an earlier version of the code.
