# Favorite tip/most beneficial to improving your design?

- My favorite tip that I think is most beneficial to improving my design is using fewer borders because it helps make your design more professional. It also won't look so cluttered.
- Extra spacing is also another one that I like along with box-shadows to add a better look.


# Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

- Dribble is a great resource to review examples of good design ideas. 
- Material.io is another great resource that will help you with good design ideas. 








# How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

- Good design will influence people to use that website more often. They will see the professionalism and the quality that the website has and also the professionalism and quality of that designer as well. When something looks nice people will keep looking at it or be more intrigued which is important for a website.
