# What is a Pseudo-Class and what is the most common one you think will be used? 

- A Psuedo-Class is a keyword added to a selector that shows a special state of the selected element.
- I think the most common Pseudo-Class that will be used is going to be :hover, :first-child and :nth-child. As we learn more about the Pseudo-class there will be a lot more common keywords that will be used, that I don't know about now. 



# What is Specificity and how might you use it in your benefit?

- Specificity is in CSS to determine what rule should be applied in case there are multiple rules going after the same element and property on that element but are assigning different values.
- It allows you to style elements in the correct way
- You most likely won't have to write as much CSS code. 
- Helps with maintaining CSS code. 


# What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature? 

- You'll have problems when it comes to debugging because it's not the natural way when using CSS.
- The flow of CSS would be disrupted. 
The selector won't accurately show the importance of all the rules inside of it. 
- The only way to override is to add another !important which might lead to even more, causing more and more problems.
