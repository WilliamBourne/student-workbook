# Wire-framing


## What is the purpose of wire-framing?
- Wireframes have three main purposes!
1. One purpose of wireframing is to keep the idea user-focused.  It's a way to see how the users would interact with the interface. You'll be able to see what the users like and also what could be changed for easier user interaction.
1. Another purpose for wireframing is to clarify and define website features. Wireframing will clearly tell the users how certain features will function and the purpose they will have. It also will clarify the page's functionality. It'll help you see how all the features will work together and decide if anything needs to be added or removed. 
1. The final purpose for Wireframing is that it's quick and extremely cheap to create. You can create a wireframe with just a pen and paper, allowing you to make a quick sketch without any money coming out of your pocket. There's also many tools available that would make possible to make a digital wireframe quickly.

## What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

 The three different types of wireframes are: 
 - Low-fidelity wireframes
 - Mid-fidelity wireframes
 - High-fidelity wireframes
 1. Low-fidelity wireframes are useful because they're simple, quick and very effective. They're a basic representation but they help decide on navigation layout, and mapping the user flow. They're useful for designers who have many concepts and want to decide which direction to go without wasting any time. 
 1. Mid-fidelity wireframes are the most commonly used wireframe of the three. They feature more accurate representations of the layout. Specific components have more detail, and features are differentiated from each other. 
 1. High-fidelity wireframes are useful for more complex concepts like menu systems or interactive maps. More detail is added to this wireframe, using pixel-specific layouts. High-fidelity wireframes are generally for the later stages of the design cycle. 

 ## Are wireframes worth the Time, Energy, and effort that they require?

 - I think wireframes are worth using. You can get a lot of feedback and ideas to make your page better. I always think it's super helpful to get the opinions of other people and people who would possibly use your website. You'll get even more ideas and can take your webpage to the next level.
